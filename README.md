### Brief summary of what we did
We created a calendar website. Sample user id and user password.
(Hong Wi) I made MySQL database, login, register, displaying the calendar, and adding schedules on the calendar. 
I tried to use fetch API to every function since fetch API is definitely preferred to XMLHttpRequest.
Deleting and sharing shcedules were made by DK Kim.
